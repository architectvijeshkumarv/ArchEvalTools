# ArchEvalTools
This repository contains a light python API for creating and running for Built environment analysis. The plugins are deeveloped for Rhino3D users, in GHPython. To used the plugin you may copy and paste the folder in "C:\Users\USERNAME\AppData\Roaming\Grasshopper\Libraries".
Right-click and go to properties of the file, and unblock it before use.
These tools are only in development stage, and I have used Rhino 6 to develop this tools.
Install pufferfish "https://www.food4rhino.com/en/app/pufferfish" before along side of the API.
Whoever interested to contribute are welcome.
