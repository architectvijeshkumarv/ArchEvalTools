# ArchEvalTools
This repository contains a light Python API for creating and running for Built environment analysis. The plugins are developed for Rhino3D users, in GHPython. To use the plugin you may copy and paste the folder in "C:\Users\USERNAME\AppData\Roaming\Grasshopper\Libraries".
Right-click and go to the properties of the file, and unblock it before use.
These tools are only in the development stage, and I have used Rhino 6 to develop these tools.
Install pufferfish "https://www.food4rhino.com/en/app/pufferfish" alongside the API.
Whoever is interested to contribute is welcome.

#SiteEval Tool
This is developed for the site analysis based on two aspects, 1. degree of slope, 2. are available under the slope domains. These two factors are essential to understand the site's development during the evaluation of the site before design development or during. This tool has a site surface division factor to divide the site to get maximum information.
